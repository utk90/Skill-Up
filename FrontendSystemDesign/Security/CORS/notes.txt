Cross Origin Resource Sharing
> by default browser uses SOP (same origin policy)

1. Origin
http://example.com:8080/foo - web URI (uniquely identifies a resource on web)
http - protocol
example.com - domain
8080 - port
foo - path

2. Same origin policy

3. CORS Headers
- Headers set by server to allow cross domain interaction

4. Access-Control-Allow-Origin
- Response header set by server to indicate which site can access its data

5. Access-Control-Allow-Credentials
- If the request is initiated with cookies in it, then server need to make sure it allows credentials in request from origin

6. Preflight request
- Request initiated by browser before making actual cross origin request
- Response of this request will tell browser about CORS header that a server may respond with
- Other CORS headers
> Access-Control-Allow-Methods - which method server allow
> Access-Control-Allow-Headers - which headers server allow
> Access-Control-Max-Age - for how long response from preflight can be reused
