The content introduces the concept of dynamic imports in JavaScript to improve application loading efficiency.
Using a chat application example, it discusses how dynamically importing modules, such as EmojiPicker, only when needed can significantly reduce 
the initial bundle size. The article demonstrates the implementation of dynamic imports using React Suspense and provides an alternative approach 
using the loadable-components library for server-side rendering (SSR) applications.

Crux:

1. Problem Statement: The article addresses the issue of unnecessary inclusion of components in the initial bundle, impacting application loading time.
2. Dynamic Import: Dynamic import of modules, especially components like EmojiPicker, is suggested to be performed only when required for rendering 
or user interaction.
3. React Suspense: The implementation of dynamic imports is shown using React Suspense, allowing the application to render faster while deferring the 
import of specific components.
4. Bundle Size Reduction: By dynamically importing EmojiPicker, the initial bundle size is reduced from 1.5MiB to 1.33 MiB, resulting in a faster
 initial load time.
5. Loadable Components: An alternative library, loadable-components, is introduced for server-side rendering (SSR) applications that do not currently 
support React Suspense. It is also highlighted as useful for client-side rendering (CSR) applications.

Note: The code snippets provided demonstrate the implementation of dynamic imports and the impact on bundle sizes.
