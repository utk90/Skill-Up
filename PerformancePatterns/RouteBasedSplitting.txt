The content discusses the concept of "Route-Based Splitting" in React applications. The idea is to request resources (components) that are specifically 
needed for certain routes, optimizing the loading process. This is achieved by combining React features like Suspense and libraries such as react-router.

Key Points:
Route-Based Splitting: Components are dynamically loaded based on the current route, ensuring that only the necessary code for that route is requested.

Implementation:
1. The code uses React, lazy loading, and the react-router library.
2. Components (App, Overview, Settings) are lazily loaded using import() and webpackChunkName for naming chunks.
3. The <Suspense> component provides a fallback UI while components are being loaded.
4. Code Example:
The App, Overview, and Settings components are lazily loaded when their respective routes are accessed.
The <Switch> component allows rendering the component associated with the matched route.
Optimization: By loading components lazily per route, only the necessary bundle for the current route is requested. This optimizes the application's
 performance by minimizing unnecessary resource loading.

Crux:
Route-Based Splitting involves dynamically loading React components based on the current route using features like lazy loading and react-router. 
This optimization ensures that only the essential code for the active route is requested, contributing to a more efficient and responsive application.
