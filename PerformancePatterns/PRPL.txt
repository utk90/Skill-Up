PRPL is an acronym for:

Push (or preload) the most important resources
Render the initial route as soon as possible
Pre-cache remaining assets
Lazy load other routes and non-critical assets

1. Introduction:
Challenge: Ensure application performance on low-end devices and in regions with poor internet connectivity.
Solution: PRPL Pattern, focusing on efficient resource loading.

2. PRPL Pattern Focuses on Four Key Performance Considerations:
Efficiently pushing critical resources to minimize roundtrips and reduce loading time.
Rendering the initial route as soon as possible for an improved user experience.
Pre-caching assets for frequently visited routes to minimize server requests and enable a better offline experience.
Lazily loading routes or assets that aren't frequently requested.

3. HTTP/2 Improvements:
HTTP/2 introduced bidirectional streams, solving head-of-line blocking issues in HTTP/1.1.
Server push: The server can automatically push additional resources without explicit client requests.

4. Server Push Considerations:
Pushed resources are not HTTP cache-aware.
PRPL Pattern uses service workers to cache pushed resources after the initial load.

5. Preload Resource Hint:
Developers can help browsers identify critical resources by adding a preload resource hint.
Preloading optimizes the time it takes to load critical resources for the current route.

6. PRPL Pattern Optimization Strategies:
Code-splitting applications into small, performant bundles.
Bundles enable users to load only the necessary resources when needed, maximizing cachability.
Caching considerations to avoid unnecessary roundtrips and make the application offline-friendly.

7. App Shell and Main Entry Point:
PRPL often uses an app shell as the main entry point, containing most of the application's logic shared between routes.
App shell includes the application's router for dynamic resource requests.

8. Dynamically Requesting Minimal Resources:
Ensure that bundles requested contain the minimal necessary resources and are cachable.
Considerations for bundling or working with unbundled modules based on performance.

9. Background Fetching for Frequently Visited Routes:
Install a service worker after the initial route is loaded to fetch resources for frequently visited routes in the background.
Enhances user experience by quickly retrieving required resources from cache for frequently visited routes.

10. Dynamic Import for Less Frequently Visited Routes:
- Resources for routes that aren't as frequently visited can be dynamically imported, optimizing performance.
In Essence:

PRPL focuses on optimizing the initial load, ensuring no other resources get requested or rendered before the initial route is visible.
Service workers play a crucial role in caching resources for frequently visited routes and enabling background fetching for a seamless user experience.
The pattern emphasizes efficient resource loading, making applications globally accessible and performant in challenging conditions.
