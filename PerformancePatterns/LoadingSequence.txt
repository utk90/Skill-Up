The content revolves around the challenges and strategies associated with optimizing the loading sequence in web applications. 
It emphasizes the importance of resource prioritization, provides recommendations for handling critical resources, and proposes an 
ideal loading sequence for improved performance and user experience. The role of tools like the ScriptLoader for Next.js is highlighted 
to assist in achieving the desired loading priorities. Overall, the aim is to provide a comprehensive guide for developers to enhance the 
loading sequence and meet Core Web Vitals metrics.

1. First Content Paint
2. Largest contentful paint
3. First Input delay

a) First Contentful Paint (FCP):

Definition: FCP measures the time it takes for the browser to render the first piece of content (text, image, etc.) on the screen.
Significance: FCP is essential for user perception of page load speed. A fast FCP ensures that users see something meaningful on the page quickly, providing an impression that the page is loading.

b) Largest Contentful Paint (LCP):

Definition: LCP measures the time it takes for the browser to render the largest content element (image or text block) within the user's viewport.
Significance: LCP is a crucial metric as it represents the point at which the main content of the page is likely visible to the user. A fast LCP contributes to a positive user experience, indicating that the critical content is available quickly.

c) First Input Delay (FID):

Definition: FID measures the time it takes for the browser to respond to the first user interaction, such as a click or tap, after the page has been rendered.
Significance: FID is crucial for assessing the page's interactivity. A low FID means that users can interact with the page without delays, enhancing the overall user experience.
