Mounting
1. Constructor
-> state initialization
-> event handler bind

2. static getDerivedSateFromProps(props, state)
 -> its main function is to ensure that the state and props are in sync for when it's required
 -> whatever object is returned from this method will update the state

3. render

4. componentDidMount
-> can be used for async. calls like API calls, setTimeout's or to add event listeners  etc.



Updating
1. getDerivedSateFromProps

2. shouldComponentUpdate
-> used to stop unnecessary renders
-> if (nextProps !== currentProps || nextState !== currentSate)
        Component will re-render
   else
        COmponent will not re-render

3. getSnapshotBeforeUpdate
-> method is invoked just before the DOM is being rendered.
-> used to store the previous values of the state after the DOM is updated
-> used to compare the props, state or elements before and after updation



Unmounting
1. componentWillUnmount
-> allows us to execute the React code when the component gets destroyed or unmounted from the DOM.
-> called before the component node gets unmounted
-> eg: remove event listeners, clear timeouts
