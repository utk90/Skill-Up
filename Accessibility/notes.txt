1. Using Semantic HTML
> use semantic HTML elements (<nav>, <header>, <footer>, <main>) to provide meaningful structure to content
> use proper heading levels (h1 to h6) to create a hierarchial structure of content

2. Focus management
> ensure the focus is managed appropriately as users navigate through the application
> use tabIndex attribute to control the order in which elements receive focus

3. Keyboard navigation
> test and ensure all interactive elements can be accessed and activated using a keyboard
> implement keyboard shortcuts for frequently used actions

4. accessible forms
> use proper form labels (<label>) and associate them with form elements using the 'for' attribute or by nesting the input inside the label
> provide meaningful error messages and instructions for form validation
> ensure that form controls are navigable and operable with a keyboard

5. ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications)
> use ARIA attributes to enhance the accessibility of dynamic and interactive element
> eg: use 'aria-labelledby' and'aria-describedby' to associate descriptive text with elements

6. contrast and color
> ensure sufficient color contrast for text and interactive elements to make content readable for users with visual impairments
> avoid conveying information solely through color; use labels, icons or patterns as alternatives

7. images and multimedia
> provide descriptive text using 'alt' attribute for images to convey their meaning
> include transcripts or captions for audio and video content
> implement accessible media players with keyboard controls

8. screen reader compatibility
> test application using screen readibility to ensure compatibility
> use proper ARIA roles and properties to enhance the reading experience for screen reader users

9. dynamic content
> ensure that dynamic content updates are announced to screen readers
> use ARIA live regions for live updates and notifications

10. Testing and QA
> perform accessiblity testing using tools like Axe, Lighthouse or WAVE
> conduct manual testing with assitive technologies such as screen readers

11. Responsive design
> implement responsive design principles to ensure application works well on various devices and screen sizes
