1. js concept of functional programming in which we can pass functions as arguments (callbacks) and return functions without any side effects (changes to program states)
2. we can transform a function with multiple arguments into a sequence of nesting functions

// normal function
sum(1,2,3) // 6

// currying function
sum(1)(2)(3) // 6

// variations of currying (all of them return 6)
1.
sum(1)(2)(3)
sum(1,2)(3)
sum(1)(2,3)
sum(1,2,3)

2.
sum(1)(2)(3)()
sum(1,2)(3)()
sum(1)(2,3)()
sum(1,2,3)()
