>> The prototype pattern allows us to easily let objects access and inherit properties from other objects.
Since the prototype chain allows us to access properties that aren't directly defined on the object itself, we can avoid duplication of methods
and properties, thus reducing the amount of memory used.

>> Object.create is a simple way to let objects directly inherit properties from other objects, by specifying the newly created
object's prototype. The new object can access the new properties by walking down the prototype chain.
