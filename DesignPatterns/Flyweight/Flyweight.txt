1. Flyweight pattern is a useful way to conserve memory when we're creating a large number of similar objects.

2. Eg. A library usually doesn't have just one copy of a book: it usually has multiple copies of the same book
It wouldn't be very useful to create a new book instance each time if there are multiple copies of the exact same book.
Instead, we want to create multiple instances of the Book constructor, that represent a single book.

3. Useful when you're creating a huge number of objects, which could potentially drain all available RAM.
